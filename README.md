## 🖋️ A Custom `printf` Implementation

Welcome to `ft_printf`, a project developed as part of the 42 curriculum. This is a handcrafted implementation of the standard `printf` function in C, designed to deepen understanding of variadic functions, format specifiers, and low-level output formatting.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Handles standard format specifiers:

- **%c** → Character
- **%s** → String
- **%d / %i** → Integer
- **%u** → Unsigned Integer
- **%p** → Pointer Address
- **%x / %X** → Hexadecimal (lower/uppercase)
- **%%** → Print a literal `%`

✅ Bonus Implementation: Supports essential formatting flags:

- **-** → Left-align output
- **0** → Zero-padding
- **#** → Prefix for hexadecimal (`0x`, `0X`)
- **+** → Force display of sign for numeric values
- **(space)** → Add a space before positive numbers
- **.precision** → Control string truncation & numeric precision

⚠️ **Limitations**:

- ❌ Does **not** support floating-point numbers (`%f`, `%e`, `%g`).
- ❌ Does **not** support octal (`%o`).

## 🔧 Installation & Usage

### **1️⃣ Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LordMikkel/ft_printf.git
cd ft_printf
```

### **2️⃣ Compile the library**

```bash
make
```

This will generate `libftprintf.a`, a static library that can be linked to your project.

### **3️⃣ Usage Example**

```c
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main()
{
    ft_printf("Hello, %s! You have %d new messages.\n", "Mikel", 42);
    return 0;
}
```

## 🔨 Makefile Rules

The Makefile includes a set of rules that help streamline the project build process and testing:


- ### 📦 **`make`**: Compile the core project
Compiles the project and generates the `libftprintf.a` static library. This is the foundation for your `ft_printf` implementation.


- ### 🏆 **`make bonus`**: Enable bonus features
Compiles and links the bonus features of the project, enabling additional formatting options such as custom flags (e.g., `Min_width`, `-`, `0`, `#`, `+`, etc.). This produces a version of the library with these extended functionalities.


- ### 🧪 **`make test`**: Run basic tests
Compiles and runs a comprehensive suite of tests for basic and complex formats. The test suite ensures your `ft_printf` works as expected, comparing it against the standard `printf` implementation. Tests cover characters, strings, integers, hexadecimals, and combinations.


- ### 🧪 **`make testbonus`**: Run bonus tests
Compiles and runs tests specifically designed for the bonus features. These tests verify that flags such as `Min_width`, `-`, `0`, `#`, `+`, and space are handled correctly. Bonus functionality ensures your `ft_printf` is more flexible and robust.


- ### 🧹 **`make clean`**: Clean up object files
Removes all object files (`.o`) from the `src/` and `src_bonus/` directories, cleaning up intermediate build files to prepare for fresh compilations.


- ### 🧹 **`make fclean`**: Full cleanup
Removes both object files and the compiled static library (`libftprintf.a`). This ensures the project is entirely cleaned, removing all generated files.


- ### 🔄 **`make re/rebonus`**: Rebuild everything
Performs a complete rebuild of the project from scratch by running `make fclean` followed by `make`. This is perfect when you need to ensure that all files are freshly compiled.

### 🎯 Example Test Results

In my `main.c`, several tests are executed to check the correctness of the `ft_printf` implementation. The tests encompass a variety of formats and edge cases, ensuring comprehensive coverage. Here's an overview:


#### 🔠 **Basic Character and String Tests**
- **Characters**: Test for basic characters like `'A'`, null characters (`\0`), and special characters like newline (`\n`).
- **Strings**: Tests for normal strings, empty strings, and long strings to check memory handling and performance.


#### 🧑‍💻 **Pointer Tests**
- Tests for printing valid pointer addresses and handling `NULL` pointers.


#### 💯 **Integer and Number Tests**
- **Integers**: Tests for positive and negative integers, as well as boundary values like `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN`.
- **Unsigned Integers**: Tests for unsigned integers, including edge cases like `UINT_MAX`.


#### 🔢 **Hexadecimal Tests**
- Verifying the correct representation of hexadecimal numbers in both lowercase (`%x`) and uppercase (`%X`).


#### 🔀 **Combination of Formats**
- Tests involving multiple format specifiers in a single print statement, ensuring that combinations work as expected.


#### 🎁 **Bonus Tests (If Defined)**
- Tests for additional flags such as `Min_width`, `-`, `0`, `#`, `+`, and space. These flags offer more control over the printed output.
- Tests with combinations of flags ensure that they work correctly when used together, e.g., `%-10.5d`, `%010d`, and `%#x`.

### 🧪 **Test Output**

Each test compares the output of `ft_printf` with the standard `printf` output. If the outputs match, the test **passes**; otherwise, it **fails**. At the end of the test suite, a summary will display:

- **Passed Tests**: Displayed in green 🟩.
- **Failed Tests**: Displayed in red 🟥.

### ☠️ Final Boss

This printf implementation passes all the tests from ultimate [ft_printf_test](https://github.com/cacharle/ft_printf_test) when you execute the 938 tests, your terminal may display an overwhelming number of warnings—don’t panic! Just let it run, and in the end, you’ll see the final test results.
